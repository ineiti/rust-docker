# Rust-Docker Chef Example

This is a simple example of a binary package depending on a library package:

- one: binary, depends on:

The goal of this repo is twofold:
1. Check how to write a Dockerfile using `cargo chef` to speed up compilation
2. Learn how to use `cargo chef` with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
